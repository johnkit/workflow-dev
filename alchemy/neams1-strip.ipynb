    "## Project/Workflow Mockup\n",
    "This notebook is intended to show some of the capabilities needed in a CMB workflow-management system. The main software components used in this mockup are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Workflow**: An specification/template of the steps and data needed to accomplish one or more simulation objectives. A CMB workflow does not define a specific sequence of activities to perform, but instead enumerates a set of *tasks* that are required and the data *assets* that are used in the process.\n",
    "* **Project**: A container for the data assets that are produced when a workflow is applied to a specific simulation objective.\n",
    "* **Task**: An activity or set of activities required to produce or modify one or more simulation assets. For this mockup, tasks are presumed to be manual activities (i.e., there are no compuational pipelines).\n",
    "* **Asset**: A data component required to complete the workflow. Asset contents are not well-defined; for now, an asset can be an smtk resource, a single file, or a folder/collection of files. Each asset in a workflow is assigned a unique \"role\" (string) which is used as its workflow identifier. Each task is specified with two list of assets, one for  prerequisite or \"consuming\" assets, and the other for assets that are created or modified by the task, aka \"producing\" assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order that tasks are performed and assets produced is not explicitly prescribed by a workflow. Instead, the workflow software tracks which tasks *can* be performed based on the presence/absence of project assets. It is anticipated that typical engineering projects/workflow will be iterative, with tasks performed multiple times based on incremental results and feedback. The main purpose of this mockup is to demonstrate the task-asset dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no SMTK code is used; this is only a mockup."
